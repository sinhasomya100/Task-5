# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Student Performance Dataset

This project presents a detailed exploratory analysis of the **StudentsPerformance.csv** dataset.  
The goal is to uncover insights into how different factors such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation affect students' academic performance in **Math, Reading, and Writing**.

## 🧪 EDA Steps Followed

### ✅ Step 1: Data Loading & Cleaning
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`  
- Cleaned column names for consistency  
- Checked for missing values and duplicates

### ✅ Step 2: Dataset Overview
- Viewed top records using `.head()`  
- Inspected data types using `.info()`  
- Generated summary statistics with `.describe()`

### ✅ Step 3: Univariate Analysis
- Countplots for categorical columns like gender, lunch, etc.  
- Histograms and boxplots for scores  
- Outlier and distribution detection

### ✅ Step 4: Correlation & Pairplot
- Correlation heatmap to identify relationships  
- Pairplot to explore multivariate score patterns

### ✅ Step 5: Bivariate Analysis
- Grouped average scores by:
  - Gender
  - Race/Ethnicity
  - Test Preparation Course
